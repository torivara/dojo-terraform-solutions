## 1. Investigate AVM

You can find the web page [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/).

Terraform modules [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/terraform/).

## 2. Look at the Azure CAF Terraform module from Microsoft

The module can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale).

Example deployment can be found [here](https://github.com/2SGo2Cloud/alz-prodlike-lab).

## 3. Create a Small Environment

```hcl
# Example structure for main.tf (simplified for illustration)

module "network" {
  source              = "<module_path>"
  # Module parameters like region, resource group name, VNet settings
}

module "vm" {
  source              = "<module_path>"
  # Parameters for VM configuration linked to the network module outputs
}

module "load_balancer" {
  source              = "<module_path>"
  # Configuration details, referencing other module outputs if necessary
}

module "nsg" {
  source              = "<module_path>"
  # NSG rules and associations
}
```

## 4. Assign a policy with terraform

To accomplish Task 4, which involves establishing a policy assignment on a resource group to deny a specific action or enforce configurations, follow this example Terraform code. This example will demonstrate creating a policy assignment that denies the creation of public IP addresses in a given resource group. This is a common policy used to ensure resources are not unintentionally exposed to the internet.

### Step 1: Define the Policy Definition

First, you need to find a suitable policy definition. The definition should be able to deny resources based on assignment parameters.

### Step 2: Assign the Policy to a Resource Group

After defining the policy, the next step is to assign it to a specific resource group. This ensures that the policy is enforced for all resources within that group.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "deny_public_ip_assignment" {
  name                 = "deny-public-ip-assignment"
  scope                = azurerm_resource_group.example.id
  policy_definition_id = azurerm_policy_definition.deny_public_ip.id

  description = "Denies the creation of public IP addresses in the resource group."
  display_name = "Deny Public IP Creation Assignment"
}
```

### Prerequisite Resource: Resource Group

Ensure you have a resource group defined in your Terraform configuration to use in the policy assignment's `scope`. If not, here's a simple example of defining a resource group:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}
```

### Combining the Pieces

To make the policy assignment work, ensure all these pieces are part of your Terraform configuration. The policy definition creates the rule that denies the creation of public IP addresses. The policy assignment applies this rule to your specified resource group.

This example demonstrates how to use Terraform to manage Azure policies for governance and compliance, ensuring that resources comply with organizational standards and practices.

## 5. Manage Multiple Environments

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment (dev/test/prod/staging)"
}

# Use the variable in resource names, tags, etc.
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "rg-${var.environment}-example"
  location = "East US"
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

# Similar approach for other resources, with adjustments for each environment as necessary
```
